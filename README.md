# GeneticModel

Simple genetic algoritm model to visualize natural selection
Models two populations (predator and prey populations)

For the prey population color is both the reproductive selection trait (female prey will mate each cycle with the most colorful male in their vincinity. The color for the child produced will be the mean of the parents) and the naturally selected trait (predators will eat the most colorful prey in their vincinity)
